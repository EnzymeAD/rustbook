# Other Enzyme frontends

Enzyme currently has experimental frontends for C/C++, Julia, Fortran, Numba, some MLIR dialects, and Rust.

General LLVM/MLIR, as well as C/C++/CUDA documentation is available at [https://enzyme.mit.edu](https://enzyme.mit.edu)  
Julia documentation is available at [https://enzyme.mit.edu/julia](https://enzyme.mit.edu/julia)  
Rust  documentation is available at [https://enzyme.mit.edu/rust](https://enzyme.mit.edu/rust)  
Enzyme-JAX (including HLO MLIR AD) is available at [https://github.com/EnzymeAD/Enzyme-JAX](https://github.com/EnzymeAD/Enzyme-JAX).
Enzyme has been demonstrated on various other languages including [Swift](https://passivelogic.com/blog/?post=using-enzyme-autodiff-with-swift&category=autodiff), and [Fortran](https://github.com/ludgerpaehler/LULESH-Fortran/blob/main/Makefile), but no frontend has been developed to improve ease of use and installation for these languages.

We have a compiler-explorer fork with support for autodiff in C/C++/CUDA, Julia, and MLIR [here](https://enzyme.mit.edu/explorer).  

Developer documentation is available at [https://enzyme.mit.edu/doxygen](https://enzyme.mit.edu/doxygen)  
Please reach out if you would like to see support for additional languages.
