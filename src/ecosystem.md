# History and ecosystem

Enzyme started as a PhD project of William Moses and Valentin Churavy, that was able to differentiate the LLVM-IR generated by a subset of C and Julia. (...)

## Enzyme frontends

We hope that as part of the nightly releases Rust-Enzyme can mature relatively fast because:

1) Unlike Enzyme.jl, Rust won't encounter bugs based on Garbage Collection, JIT, or Type Unstable code.
2) Unlike Clang, we do ship the source code for the standard library. On the Rust side, we therefore don't need to manually add support for functions like [`_ZSt18_Rb_tree_decrementPKSt18_Rb_tree_node_base`](https://github.com/EnzymeAD/Enzyme/pull/764/files#diff-33703e707eb3c80e460e135bec72264fd2380201070a2959c6755bb26c72a504R190).
3) Minimizing Rust code is reasonably nice and Cargo makes it easy to reproduce bugs.


## Non-alternatives

TODO: Talk about why this can't be done reasonably in any other way than adding it to the language.
